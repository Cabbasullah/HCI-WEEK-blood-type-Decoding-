        <h3>
            When a person receives a blood transfusion, it is essential to make sure that the donor's blood type is compatible with
            the receiver's blood type. <br>Receiving a blood type that is not compatible with your own can be life-threating,<br> so blood
            banks always make sure to note the type of blood they receive from donors so that they can ensure a safe transfusion.
